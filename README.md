## Features

- **Plan & Agent Modes** - Read-only analysis or full code execution permissions
- **Project Management** - Link local folders with automatic Git remote detection
- **Real-time Tool Execution** - See bash commands, file edits, and web searches as they happen
- **Git Worktree Isolation** - Each chat session runs in its own isolated worktree
- **Integrated Terminal** - Full terminal access within the app
- **Change Tracking** - Visual diffs and PR management

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from source (free)

```bash
# Prerequisites: Bun, Python, Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS)
bun install
bun run claude:download  # Download Claude binary (required!)
bun run build
bun run package:mac  # or package:win, package:linux
```

> **Important:** The `claude:download` step downloads the Claude CLI binary which is required for the agent chat to work. If you skip this step, the app will build but agent functionality won't work.
